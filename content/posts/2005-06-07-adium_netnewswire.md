This is an [Adium][] plug-in script that will insert a link to the url
of the headline you are currently viewing in [NetNewsWire][]. This
works in a similar way to the standard "Safari" button that inserts a
link to the web page you are currently viewing in Safari, but for your
RSS aggregator.

It can insert an HTML link, which works in most chat clients, or a
plain-text URL if your chat partner's client won't/can't render HTML.
To use, either select the scripts from the menus (Edit/Insert
Script/...), or type `/nnw` or `/nnwurl` in a chat/message window.

Download the bundle below. The source code is available at my [svn
repository][1]. See also [this blog entry][2].
