When I tried to send an email on my new [iiNet][1] last night, I
discovered that outgoing port 25 was blocked. This is quite common
with ISPs, since it tends to prevent a good deal of spam and other
malware activity. But it's a nuisance for me, since I like to send
mail via my own mail server.

But, unlike many other ISPs (not looking at anyone *cough* bigpond in
particular), iiNet let you turn off the blocking if you know what
you're doing.

Nice touch.
