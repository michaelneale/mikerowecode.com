When I recently [broke my finger][1] (the pinky on my right hand) I
realised that I'm a better typer than I thought. Because losing the
use of just the finger has slowed me down significantly. I'm almost
back to two-finger hunt-and-peck typing. Hopefully I'll be able to
un-learn the bad habits when it heals.

I suppose I should be greatful it wasn't my _left_ hand, since that
would make using Emacs almost impossible.
