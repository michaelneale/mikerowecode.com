Last year, I [bought some EarJams][1] for my iPod.

They were passable, but I was getting increasingly frustrated with the
lack of accuracy or balanced frequency response. In fact, I reverted
to using just the naked Apple-provided buds, since at least they were
more or less faithful to the original sound (if a little tinny unless
manually held firmly in ones ear).

So for my recent birthday, thanks to some cash from my mum and dad, I
splashed on a pair of Shure [E2c in-ear 'phones][2]. And it's probably
the best technology purchase I've made in a while. They feel
"serious" (solid is probably not the best word to describe in-ear head
phones), the cable is substantial without being too stiff, and they
look pleasingly "techy". But most of all, the sound.

A friend had told me about a pair of Etymotics he had tried, how he
could hear all sorts of things in recordings he'd never noticed
before... and it's the same with these Shures. The level of detail I
can now hear, especially the live sound of classical recordings, is
incredible. Of course, with some artists, like [Glenn Gould][3], this
is not necessarily a good thing. ;)

The overall balance is great, and the sound is lively and crisp across
all musical styles--from thumpathumpa bass to an orchestral sound
stage. I'm a happy camper. :)
