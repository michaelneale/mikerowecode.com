<p>My son broke his arm today. I'm very proud. I've never broken any
bones (well, except my big toe, but that hardly counts), and he's gone
and busted his arm before he's even four! He did it riding his new
bike, of course; lost control going down a little hill.</p>

<p>He was obviously in pain, so Jo took him to the doctor, where he
got x-rays and the whole deal. They said he was exceptionally brave,
even when they had to put his are back in place before applying the
plaster. And the first thing Kian does when he gets home? Goes outside
and climbs the freaking fence! There's no stopping this boy.</p>
