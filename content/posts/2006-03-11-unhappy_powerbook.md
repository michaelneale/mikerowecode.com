Well, some months have passed since my [happy ending][1]. Turns out it
wasn't the end, and it wasn't so happy.

After a few weeks, my screen started playing up again. It was just an
occasional flicker at first, but quickly degenerated into being almost
unusable. I took the PowerBook back into the [shop][2] for another
look, but they weren't too optimistic. In a nutshell, they tried
everything short of replacing parts, and the most likely part that
would need to be replaced was the screen--at around AUD1,500, not
really worth it.

The screen more or less behaves itself when left on for long periods
(the problem seems to be partly heat related), so it was ok during the
day at the office. But it is pretty useless for the train or coffee
shop. So, I resigned myself to having a portable desktop. I bought a
17" LCD display for home, which along with an external keyboard and
[Mighty Mouse][3] makes for quite a usable office machine.

Sigh. Maybe next time, I'll get the extended warranty...
