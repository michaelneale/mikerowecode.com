I'm a little disappointed that Apple are charging AUD129 for the
upgrade to [Aperture 2][1]. Sure, there are a bunch of new, and very
attractive, features that would otherwise make paying for the upgrade
acceptable, but it seems a bit rich given that the full retail price
has dropped from USD300 to USD200. Effectively, people who bought 1.x
are getting hit twice.

But I guess it doesn't bother me enough to stop me buying the
upgrade...
