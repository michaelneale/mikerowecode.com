And in the latest [installment][] in an [ongoing][] [tradition][]...
I've moved my blog! This time, to [github pages][]. Now they can worry
about keeping servers running, and generating HTML from my text when I
commit and all of those little details.

The migration was relatively painless--more details on the mechanics
to follow. But if you can see this, it worked!

(Aside: all the templates and content that runs this blog is available
on [github][].)
