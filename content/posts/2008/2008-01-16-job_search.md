It's been a while coming, but here is a quick update on my job search:

Whether it was my [letter to recruiters][1], or just dumb luck, I ended up finding and accepting a pretty good contract job back in November. A product company, smart people, great relaxed environment. More or less everything on my list. Even a kick-ass coffee machine in the office. As expected, it was a smaller "boutique" recruiter that came through.

I've had a happy and productive couple of months.

Then this week, the company was bought by Microsoft and my contract terminated
early. \*sigh\* More job search news to come, I guess.
