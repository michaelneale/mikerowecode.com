I want a new job. And I want one that doesn't suck. So doing the regular browse-the-job-boards-and-ring-recruiters dance didn't appeal.

Instead, I sent this letter (lightly personalised) to a small number of the less sucky recruiters I know:

> Dear [Recruiter],

> I'd like to ask for your help in my search for the "perfect"
  development job.

> As you can see from my resume at
  http://www.mojain.com/michael/resume, I'm currently employed as a
  Java developer (on a rolling contract), but am I looking for
  something better.

> By better, I mean some fairly specific things:

> I will be working at a product company. That is, a company that
  produces software as (one of) its primary activities. I am not
  interested in jobs in corporate IT shops or consulting companies.

> I will be working with other enthusiastic developers who have a
  similar attention to detail and a commitment to doing things the
  right way. The organisation's management will realise that a tightly
  constrained development environment is not usually the way to get
  the best out of skilled developers. And they'll care about doing
  things the right way too.

> I would prefer to work on back-end, infrastructure or framework
  software, but I have experience in front end web development too.

> My perfect job would offer flexible work arrangements, ideally
  including the option of working at home at least some of the time.
  I'm not interested in a company that thinks the most important thing
  is that I'm sitting at a desk looking busy during "office hours".

> I know I haven't said much about myself and what I offer here. I
  want to narrow down my search to jobs I'd actually consider taking
  before wasting everyone's time talking about myself.

> Thanks for listening, and I look forward to working with you on my
  search!

I'll let you know what happens next... :)
