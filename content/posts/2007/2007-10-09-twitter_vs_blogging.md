I was never exactly a blogging over-achiever, but I can't help
noticing that I've been even quieter here than usual, since
discovering [twitter](http://twitter.com/mrowe). I guess being able to
blast out anything I'm thinking in a sentence or two acts as a sort of
pressure release, and the "head of steam" necessary to actually blog
(_that's a verb now, right?_) something is never able to build.

Must Try Harder. Thanks for the nudge,
[Daniel](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/414/no-more-excuses).

Oh, what am I doing right now? Consolidating dozens of email folders I
thought I used to "organise" my email (i.e. spend too much time
deciding where to file it and never look at it again) into a small
number of actually-useful folders. Well, maybe-useful... we'll
see how it goes.
