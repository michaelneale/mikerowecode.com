I really should learn to [read][1] [reviews][2] _before_ I rush out
and buy something...

So, I grabbed a set of [Griffin EarJams][3] for my iPod yesterday. I
was finding the standard iPod ear buds difficult to keep in my ears if
I moved my head at all. And the EarJams promised "**massive** bass"
and "improved sound", along with the "enhanced comfort" of in-ear
buds.

Well, they were certainly right about the massive bass, but they
neglected to mention the massively attenuated top end. The "jams" are
indeed quite comfortable in my ears, but the sound is muddied and
flat. 

It's quite disappointing, because I wasn't unhappy with the sound
quality of the ear buds that came with my iPod, I just wanted them to
stay in my ears while I walked. But even after playing with the "eq"
settings on the iPod to pull the bass back a bit, I just couldn't
listen to music through the things. I suppose they will be ok for
podcasts (such as the excellent ABC [Radio National][4] ones).

I guess I'll have to save up for some "real" in-ear headphones.
