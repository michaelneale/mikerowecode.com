The [ABC][] have announced plans to trial podcasting [Radio National][] programmes. This is Good News. Up until now, they have
provided live and "on demand" Real Audio [streams][] of many programs, but
this hasn't helped those of us that wanted to listen while offline
(e.g. on the train, or on a [portable media player][]). It also forced
you to use the godawful Real player.

But soon, there will be MP3s! It sounds like they are planning to
provide both downloadable MP3s and an RSS "[podcast][]" feed. Way
cool!
