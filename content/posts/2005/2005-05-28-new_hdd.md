So, Friday afternoon I picked up my powerbook, resplendant with its
new hard disk. Thanks to [Desktop Power][] for the quick turn around.
They had installed panther, so of course the first thing I did was to
do a clean install of Tiger.

I briefly considered partitioning the disk to allow me install linux,
but I figured... what's the point? I'm very happy using OS X, and if I
need to run linux for some reason, the [Ubuntu][] live cd works a
treat. 

So a few hours of installing and configuring and restoring later, I
was back up and running. 

While I had what I thought was a complete backup of my home directory,
it turned out there were a few gaps... I had made the backup by
dragging /Users/mrowe to an external firewire in Finder.
Unfortunately, Finder ignores little things like dot files
(.bash_profile, .emacs, .muttrc). :-/

Fortunately, I have the equivalents of all of those files on my linux
desktop, so it didn't take too much work to fine-tune them for my
powerbook. But the first thing I did afterwards was whack them all in
subversion. :)
