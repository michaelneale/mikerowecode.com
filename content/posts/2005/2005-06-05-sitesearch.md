Finally, I have [Google][] [site search][] working. (See the search box
on the left.) I'm not sure what the problem was, but the last few
times I tried, google claimed not to have any indexed pages for
mojain.com. Which was demonstrably wrong, since I came up in
searches. But anyway, it works now. If only I had some interesting
content... ;)
