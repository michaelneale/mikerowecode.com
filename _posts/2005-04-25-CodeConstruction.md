title: Code Construction
---

I have a bit of a thing about it. Crappy code. Or, more to the point,
crappy habits and attitudes towards writing code. I am trying to make
a career of helping organisations write better code, so below is a
description of what I mean by "code construction techniques" and why I
think it's important.

You'll hear a lot of people talk about process, methodologies and
software engineering. All that is great, and certainly necessary, but
it's not what I'm talking about here. Beyond all the use cases,
requirements engineering, document control and repeatable processes,
at some point somebody's got to sit down and write some code. And I
can assure you that I've seen some pretty badly written code, even on
projects that could well get their organisations CMM Level 5
certification.
