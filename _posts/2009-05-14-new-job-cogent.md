title: A new start
---

I have a new job, and contrary to what I've [said previously][], it's
at a consulting company. With a differnce.

**[Cogent][]** *is* a consulting company, but with ambitions to be a
product company. In fact, I've spent my first few weeks here working
on our first publicly available product, [Runway][]. (Runway is a
task management app that supports the principals of Getting Things
Done&reg;.)

I'm really excited to be here. Cogent has an explicit goal of treating
its employees *and* its customers humanely. It's very open and free of
bureaucratic nonsense. And it's full of really smart people--although
the average probably just went down bit... :-)
