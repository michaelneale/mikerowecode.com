<p>... so here is a sort-of diary of what I've been up to, mostly for
her benefit. Like anyone else would find it remotely
interesting...</p>

<b>Friday</b>

<p>Went straight to work from airport. I was surprised how quick the
trip is now, with the "new" (well to me anyway) CityLink freeway
taking me all the way to the bottom of Spencer St. Since I am working
at that end of Collins St, I was right there. Well, apart from the 10
minutes it took to drive up to the 10th level of the fscking car
park.</p>

<p>After work, went to the pub with a few people from work. Only
stayed for two pots, since I had to drive home. Once home I had a
snack (dry crackers *sniff*) and then sat down in front of
<cite>Chopper</cite>. Actually stayed awake until the end,
remarkably. Just.</p>
