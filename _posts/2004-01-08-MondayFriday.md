Monday - Friday

<p>Well, as expected, I've left it too long between drinks, and I've
forgotten most of what I did last week. No doubt beer was involved. Or
maybe I'm just getting old. Most of my waking hours were spent at
work, of course. Still plenty of left overs in the fridge, so sign of
any cooking activities yet.</p>

<p>Thursday night I went to cricket training, and then dinner at Gav
and Emma's. Pizza! Beer!! Black Adder!?! It doesn't get much better
than this. Had a couple of drinks after work with Janis and Craig,
then stopped by Andrew's on the way home to have a beer and try to
watch the rugby. Odd game, really. </p>
