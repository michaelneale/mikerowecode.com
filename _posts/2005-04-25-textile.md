Installed Textile2

I've just installed the
[Textile2](http://molelog.molehill.org/blox/Computers/Internet/Web/Blosxom/Textile/)
plug-in for [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com/) based on Brad Choate's
[Perl
implementation](http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2003/07/08/mttextile) of
Dean Allen's [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) text
markup language. (See how easy it makes gratuitous linking?)

Textile allows me to put simple markup in my blog files, and get it
automagically turned into nice HTML (HyperText Markup Language). 

This is a long-ish paragraph containing single line-break characters,
so that it looks nice in my editor. Hopefully, Textile will not care
about these line breaks and still flow the whole block nicely into
HTML. [_Time passes_...] Unfortunately,
Textile _did_ care, and I had to make a small, unapproved patch to
the Perl module to make it leave paragraphs alone:

    diff -r1.1 Textile.pm
    715c715,718
    <                     $result .= $self->{line_close} ."\n";
    ---
    >                     # ROWE HACK - we don't want paras split up with 
    >                     #             break tags, damn it!
    >                     #$result .= $self->{line_close} ."\n";
    >                     $result .= "\n";

I don't know yet (after exhaustively testing the change on, well, just
this entry) what else that will impact. But I can't think of any
reason I'd want break tags anywhere else anyway, so it should be fine.
