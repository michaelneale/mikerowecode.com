title: PHP is the new VB

It just occurred to me today... PHP is the new VB! 

...


Not that you can't write good PHP code, of course. For all I know,
maybe it's even possible to write good VB code. But the trouble is, by
lowering the barrier to entry you end up with all sorts of morons
convinced they can be programmers too.
