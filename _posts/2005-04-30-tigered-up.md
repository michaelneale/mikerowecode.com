I'm all tigered up!

So, I took myself off to the local AppleCentre Friday evening, just after 6pm, like a good fanboy. :) Unfortunately, family and social commitments (what sort of a geek am I?) prevented me from installng it until this morning, but now I'm in dashboard and spotlight bliss.

The Good
--------

Apart from all the eye-candy goodness of dashboard, etc., the number one highlight so far is the built-in ability to map caps-lock to control. Which is just as well, because I pretty much can't use a computer with out the control key where it's _meant_ to be, and my previous solution, [uControl](http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/ucontrol.html), doesn't work with Tiger. Big thanks to Apple for making it standard.

The Bad
-------

Alas, alak! Emacs (the aqua version) doesn't work! The horror! Even a simple rebuild from source didn't work either. And google didn't help... So I'm creating this entry in a substandard editor until I find a solution...
