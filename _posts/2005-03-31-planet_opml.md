title: Planets provide OPML
---

This is probably not news to anyone else, but the ever-increasing
world of blog "planets" ([Planet Linux
Australia](http://planet.linux.org.au/), [Kernel
Planet](http://kernelplanet.org/), [Debian
Planet](http://planet.debian.net/)) often provide an OPML file
containing all their subscriptions, ready for importing into your
favourite aggregator (like NetNewsWire). Cool.

But how do I stay up to date when new feeds are added?
