Griffin EarJams Revisited

I was quite quick to [complain
about](http://www.mojain.com/~mrowe/blog/geek/griffin_earjams.html)
about my ear jams. I'm tempering my original judgement a
little... after giving them a bit more of a go, I'm finding listening
to some types of music decent enough. (E.g. The White Stripes, who
seem to be heavy on the mid-range in production anyway, or Beck, where
the prominent bottom end really helps.)

Just don't try for anything like a Bach violin concerto. I'm still
saving for a really good pair of in-ear buds.
