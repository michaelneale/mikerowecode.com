Saturday - Sunday

<p>Up early this morning. Went down to the shops to get the paper, but
The Age was late from the printers :-/ . After breakfast, I went over
to Rebel Sport to change my cricket pants. They didn't have any in the
size I wanted, but they called up the Greensborough store, and they
did. On the way there, I dropped past our new house.</p>

<p>Between all this and messing around in the shopping center, it was
time to head home and get ready for cricket. The first day of the
match was pretty uneventful, we batted out the day. I went in at
number six (was meant to be seven, but the previous guy went missing)
and lasted a few overs for 2.</p>

<p>Since it was the first day, we all headed back to the club's rooms
for a couple of beers with the guys. Cheap VBs! Went out for dinner
with Andrew, Belinda and Lynn to some Malaysian place Andrew had
seen. Which turned out not to be licenced (even byo!). The food was
ok, but it took forever to come.</p>

<p>Old Man Michael was exhausted by the end of dinner, so I went home
to bed.</p>

<h3>Sunday</h3>

<p>Quiet day at home. Had the usual for breakfast. Caught up on some
email. Went for a drive in the afternoon. Still someone working on the
house, so I couldn't snoop around. Watched a couple of Black Adder
episodes in the evening (don't tell Gav!).</p>
