Giving up on blosxom

I'm giving up on blosxom. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but the advantages of keeping my [blog][1] in [Drupal][2] are too great to ignore.

I liked the idea of blosxom, and I love having a local copy of my blog in plain text (and being able to manage it in subversion), but the hassle of maintaining another bunch of HTML/CSS, and the extra work involved in adding functionality like comments, is just not worth it.

So, look [over here][1] for future (frequent?) posts. :) I'll get around to bringing the blosxom content across and putting in redirects soon.
