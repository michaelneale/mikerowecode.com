Setting up WordPress for a friend

Last night, I set up [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) for a
friend. They [claim](http://wordpress.org/docs/installation/5-minute/)
on the website it takes less than five minutes. And they were right!
In fact, I also added a domain to my DNS, configured an apache vhost
and set up an email forwarder in the same time. :-O
