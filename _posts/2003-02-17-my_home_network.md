At home, my main workstation is a 400Mhz AMD K6 running <a
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> (currently woody, but I can
also boot into sid if I'm feeling daring). It also has <a
href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and an old unloved version
of <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/">Debian GNU/Hurd</a>
installed.

We've also got a server running Debian (woody/stable), an Gateway
Pentium Pro 200 MHz, which handles our email, databases and web
developement, and other useful services like DNS and DHCP.

There's also a couple of laptops (untethered courtesy of NetGear
802.11b cordless ethernet cards).

Connecting it all the outside world is a cable modem and a dedictated
firewall/NAT gateway (OpenBSD on a Compaq Pentium 100 MHz). My
heartless wife will not let me get more computers. :(
