Drupal module - summary

My first "official" open source contribution: a module for [Drupal][1]
that I threw together for the [family web site][2] called
[summary][3]. It's intent is to allow a summary page for a drupal
site, displaying headlines for recent photos and stories.

It has since been taken over and completey revamped by [Nedjo
Rogers][4], somewhat for the better I hasten to add. As well as making
it much more theme- and drupal-compliant, Nedjo moved the lists of
headlines into a block, making layout control easier.

I still hope to contribute to the module, and other drupal
development, in the future.
