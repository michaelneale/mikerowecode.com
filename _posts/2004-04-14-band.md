We're putting the band back together!

Well, "band" may be over-selling it a little... Anyhow, Andy B and I
had a bit of jam yesterday. Sad, really, how little actual ability I
have to play the bass. Maybe I should practice some time. But at least
it got me out of the house for a couple of hours, and it's always good
to stretch the brain cells in a different direction to usual.

Speaking of the home front, it has been an action packed couple of
weeks, with Kian's birthday and easter and all. He's very excited
about being four. Temma has also been developing in leaps and bounds,
and is now crawling all over the house with great aplomb. She'd really
prefer to be walking, I think, but will have to wait until she has a
bit more balance.

Jo has uploaded tons of photos to the [family website][1] so be sure
to check them out. I've upgraded the site to [Drupal][2] 4.4. This
included a small [patch][3] to the image module to give me a block
that lists image galleries, so the navigation has changed a little.
