PHP namespace

This comment from the [Drupal Theme developer's guide][1] is an
example of why whatever your question, PHP is not the answer:

> An important note- when developing a theme using any of the methods
  described here, you must be sure that the name of the theme is not
  the same as the name of any module being used on the site because
  the function names may collide and your site may no longer function
  correctly.
