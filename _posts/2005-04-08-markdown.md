Markdown text markup

[Markdown][1] looks like it
might be nicer than textile...

And now, for some **formating** tests.

A Heading
=========

Below is a _blockquote_ (from [DaringFireball][1]):

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
>
> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A
> Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain
> text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or
> formatting instructions. While Markdown's syntax has been influenced
> by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source
> of inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text
> email.

A Smaller Heading
-----------------

Arbitrary HTML tags can also be used, such as <span style="color:red">span
tags</span> to set colours. Not that I'd do *that* of course.

 * This is an item
 * This is another item

### A Really Small Heading

And these are:

1. the first item
2. the second item, and
3. the third item
