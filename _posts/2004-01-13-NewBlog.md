New Blog - Blosxom

<p>Trying out some new blogging software, <a
href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> (pronounced
"blossom"). It's actually rather neat, in a minimalist kind of way. A
simple Perl wrapper that turns text files into -- optionally templated
-- HTML. Much more light-weight than big old database-backed stuff
(like <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a>, which I'm also
using).</p>

<p>I've set up my blog directory as a CVS module, with a check-in trigger
to automatically update the live web-sever directory whenever I check
in a new (or updated) file. For the curious, the follow entry in
CVSROOT/loginfo in my CVS repo does the trick:</p>

<pre>^blog (date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /home/mrowe/www/blog; cvs -q update -Pd) &) \
    >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/updatelog 2>&1</pre>

<p>This means: match any check in for a module starting with "blog", then
wait a couple of seconds (for the check in to complete), change to the
web server directory, and run a cvs update.</p>

<p>Wait, there's more! You also get... syndication to the main mojain.com
site. I've added a block (currently custom--you have to add it in your
account set up) that displays and links to the latest blog entries.</p>

<p>How cool is this? Blogging made almost transparent! Just dump current
brain state into text file, and commit to cvs! How much easier could
it be? Still remains to be seen how often I do it, of course...</p>
