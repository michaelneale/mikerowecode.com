Problem adding a user in Mac OS X

Weird... I tried to create an account for a friend on my Powerbook
today (Mac OS X Tiger 104.1), and it kept failing.  Well, it appeared
to work ok (no errors in the GUI), but the account would not be
created.  I tried a couple of times (thinking I must have hit the
wrong button or something), but same result.  In the system.log, the
following lines appeared:

    2005-06-05 09:06:07.121 System Preferences[16863] ### Error:-14120 File:DSRecord.m Line:349
    2005-06-05 09:06:07.124 System Preferences[16863] ### Error:-14120 File:DSRecord.m Line:349

A quick google [search][] turned up nothing. So I rebooted and tried
again, and it worked. Weird.
