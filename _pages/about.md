Hi! My name is Michael Rowe and this is my web site.

Here I write about what ever is on my mind, which tends to be related
to running and programming computers, since that's <a href="{{
site.url }}/michael/resume.html">what I do</a>.

You can contact me <a href="mailto:mrowe@mojain.com">by email</a>, or
follow my <a href="http://twitter.com/mrowe">Twitter feed</a> if
you're so inclined.

Old posts are <a href="{{ site.url }}/archive.html">archived here</a>.

Made with _Jekyll_ using a lightly modified version of the <a
href="https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/">Tale</a> theme.
